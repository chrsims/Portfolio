            <p>Throughout high school I competed on the varsity Policy Debate team. Over my I have 350+ debate rounds, which is over 700 hours debating. My senior year, I was awarded with Outstanding Distinction by the National Speech and Debate Association for competitive success, given to less than 1% of debaters.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I love the outdoors. I have backpacked over 100 miles throughout different trails in California, New Mexico, and Oregon. My love for nature was sparked by my involvement in Boy Scouts, where I was a Senior Patrol Leader and Life Scout.</p>

            <p>I also have a passion for teaching. Beyond my work as an SAT Tutor, I have worked as a Debate Coach for ModernBrain Academy & Ridgecrest Intermediate. I mentored a class of 20 students and taught them difficult debate concepts. I revel in the art of communicating my ideas with words, and teaching is a great exercise in effective communication.</p>

            <p>I started playing soccer as a kid living in England. I grew up in a small, quiet suburb by London called Walton-on-Thames. My family loved nothing more than a map and the open European road. Growing up in Europe not only gave me an unhealthy obsession with Premier League Soccer and a British accent, but also instilled within me a profound sense of cosmopolitanism.</p>

            <p> Other than that, I enjoy hiking, skiing, and surfing — everything outdoors. If I’m not inside coding, I’m outside enjoying the fresh air and sun.</p>
